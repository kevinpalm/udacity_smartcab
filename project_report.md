**QUESTION 1**: Observe what you see with the agent's behavior as it
takes random actions. Does the smartcab eventually make it to the
destination? Are there any other interesting observations to note?

**ANSWER 1**: When the agent is taking random actions, I notice that the
rewards are mostly negative. It looks like the agent runs a lot of red
lights, cuts other drivers off, ect. While I was watching the agent
never arrived at a target destination, but taking random actions could
theoretically get the agent there. There would just be a lot of luck
involved. I also notice that when the agent goes off the side of the
map, it appears on the opposite side - so this grid is actually a
flattened sphere.
